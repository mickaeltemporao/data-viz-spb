## Overview

How can we convey a simple message from complex information?
In a era where data is ubiquitous, the ability to produce visualizations has become an essential skill for journalists, researchers, and any professional working with data in their projects or decision-making.

This workshop offers a step-by-step introduction to data visualization using the Python programming language. No prior knowledge in these areas is required.
Situated within a broader reflection on the uses of dataviz in the social sciences, the workshop will focus on learning how to handle and simplify empirical data in order to produce clear visualizations with a precise message. Throughout the module, themes such as polarization, the knowledge gap, electoral participation, and political trust will be explored.


## By the end of the semester, you will be able to:
* Design and produce charts for your projects.
* Carry out the key steps of a visualization project: loading, preparing, analyzing, and producing figures.
* Select the most relevant type of visualization depending on your data and the message you wish to convey.
* Use essential Python libraries for data visualization.

## Assessment

Following an incremental approach, this module is assessed through continuous evaluation based on intermediate assignments.
These assignments culminate in a final submission in the form of a polished infographic.
